## Tree - Tree is the collection of nodes where one of the node is taken as root node and rest of the nodes are divided into disjoint subsets where each subset is a subtree.
if n nodes then n-1 edges

1. Root
2. Parent
3. Child - Descendents of a parent node
4. Siblings - Descendents of a same parent node
5. Descendents - set of nodes under that node reached thorugh a path
6. Ancestors - Form a node all the nodes from that node to a root node along a path
7. Degree of a node - Number of direct children
8. Degree of a tree - Tree with a node with max number of children
9. Internal/External nodes - (leaf/non-leaf nodes) leaf: Nodes with degree 0
10. Levels - Level starts from 1. Root is at level 1. i.e number of nodes along a path
11. Height - Height starts from 0. Root is at height 0. i.e. Height at a node is the number of edges took to read a node
12. Forest - Collection of trees

### Binary Tree - Tree with degree 2
